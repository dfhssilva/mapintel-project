	title = "Enabling the discovery of thematically related research objects with systematic spatializations",
	abstract = "It is challenging for scholars to discover thematically related research in a multidisciplinary setting, such as that of a university library. In this work, we use spatialization techniques to convey the relatedness of research themes without requiring scholars to have specific knowledge of disciplinary search terminology. We approach this task conceptually by revisiting existing spatialization techniques and reframing them in terms of core concepts of spatial information, highlighting their different capacities. To apply our design, we spatialize masters and doctoral theses (two kinds of research objects available through a university library repository) using topic modeling to assign a relatively small number of research topics to the objects. We discuss and implement two distinct spaces for exploration: a field view of research topics and a network view of research objects. We find that each space enables distinct visual perceptions and questions about the relatedness of research themes. A field view enables questions about the distribution of research objects in the topic space, while a network view enables questions about connections between research objects or about their centrality. Our work contributes to spatialization theory a systematic choice of spaces informed by core concepts of spatial information. Its application to the design of library discovery tools offers two distinct and intuitive ways to gain insights into the thematic relatedness of research objects, regardless of the disciplinary terms used to describe them.",

	abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values.}

	abstract = {Clustering constitutes one of the most popular and important tasks in data analysis. This is true for any type of data, and geographic data is no exception. In fact, in geographic knowledge discovery the aim is, more often than not, to explore and let spatial patterns surface rather than develop predictive models. The size and dimensionality of the existing and future databases stress the need for efficient and robust clustering algorithms. This need has been successfully addressed in the context of general-purpose knowledge discovery. Geographic knowledge discovery, nonetheless can still benefit from better tools, especially if these tools are able to integrate geographic information and aspatial variables in order to assist the geographic analyst’s objectives and needs. Typically, the objectives are related with finding spatial patterns based on the interaction between location and aspatial variables. When performing cluster-based analysis of geographic data, user interaction is essential to understand and explore the emerging patterns, and the lack of appropriate tools for this task hinders a lot of otherwise very good work. In this paper, we present the GeoSOM suite as a tool designed to bridge the gap between clustering and the typical geographic information science objectives and needs. The GeoSOM suite implements the GeoSOM algorithm, which changes the traditional Self-Organizing Map algorithm to explicitly take into account geographic information. We present a case study, based on census data from Lisbon, exploring the GeoSOM suite features and exemplifying its use in the context of exploratory data analysis.}

It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently‐occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.},

Through a learning process, this neural network creates a mapping from a N-dimensional space to a two-dimensional plane of units (neurons). This mapping is known to preserve topological relations of the N-dimensional space. A specially developed technique, called U-matrix method has been developed in order to detect nonlinearities in the resulting mapping. This method can be used to visualize structures of the N-dimensional space. Boundaries between different subsets of input data can be detectet. This allows to use this method for a clustering of the data. New data can be classified in an associative way. It has been demonstrated, that the method can be used also for knowledge acquisition and exploratory data analysis purposes.",

This is in general a good practice; however, many important factors should be taken into account. Neural-network methods in general, and the SOM process in particular do not produce such unique results as some deterministic mathematical algorithms, e.g., the Fast Fourier Transform. Adaptive processes may proceed in unexpected ways depending on the parameters and training sequences selected. At least in the beginning, the learning process may seem to fluctuate in an unpredictable fashion. Therefore special precautions must be taken.",

Each document is encoded as a histogram of word categories which are formed by the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm based on the similarities in the contexts of the words. The encoded documents are organized on another self-organizing map, a document map, on which nearby locations contain similar documents. Special consideration is given to the computation of very large document maps which is possible with general-purpose computers if the dimensionality of the word category histograms is first reduced with a random mapping method and if computationally efficient algorithms are used in computing the SOMs.}
