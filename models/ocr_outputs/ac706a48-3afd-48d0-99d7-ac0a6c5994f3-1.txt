Project Abstract:

Competitive Intelligence (Cl) is concerned with gathering and analyzing information on any aspect
of the business environment (competition, customers, legal framework, etc.) needed to support
executives in strategic planning and decision-making. AICEP’s mission is to promote Portuguese
exports and to secure foreign direct investment, playing a major role in the economic
development and job creation in Portugal. Cl is a key component of AICEP’s activity, which
requires keeping track of current affairs and sift through the endless flow of news about markets,
trade, industries, countries and politics.

The ability to quickly identify, process and understand the impact of political, economic and social
events in the world arena constitutes a fundamental requirement to accomplish AICEP’s mission.
These events can create new opportunities but can also present new threats and challenges to the
Portuguese economy. Most relevant data for this purpose is unstructured, more specifically text
data, in the form of news, reports, trade agreements, company announcements, etc. However,
these data are not yet widely used by AICEP as a source to gather competitive strategic
intelligence. The main reason behind this is the difficulty in the extraction of information from text
data. In an activity in which timing and assertive responses are of the essence, having analysts
sorting through the Internet to find relevant news and updates is ineffective, timeconsuming and
expensive. In order to keep up with competing Nations, looking to take advantage of the same
trading and investment opportunities, Portugal, through AICEP, needs to have available a modern
Cl infrastructure.

Document clustering can be seen as the unsupervised learning task that extracts otherwise hidden
structures and relations from text data by grouping similar documents into clusters. The nature of
Cl activity is an excellent fit for a system able to bring together document clustering with
interactive visual analytics, as it involves serendipity in retrieval, browsing, and exploration of text
documents. Such a system should be able to direct the analyst’s attention to the most relevant
information items and allow for efficient exploration of very large document databases.

In this project we propose a neural network-based document clustering system, which is a genuine
content-addressable memory system, meaning it clusters and stores text documents so they can
be retrieved based on their content. Through the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM’s), documents
are mapped as points on a semantic map, in a topological order that describes the similarity of
their contents. This map is then used as a metaphor to interact with the text corpus, creating an
interactive visual analytics tool, allowing for its exploration through different, but correlated views
and iteratively selecting and examining documents. This means the user can browse through
point-and-click, brushing and linking between different views and graphical features or by using
prototype examples (e.g. “all the documents similar to this”). An example of this type of
environment can be found in our previous project GEoSOM (Henriques et al. 2012), developed by
the NOVA IMS team, for clustering and interactive exploration of geo-referenced data. Recent
research in text feature extraction, through the use of algorithms such as doc2vec to produce
word embeddings, created new opportunities in document clustering. Doc2vec, an adaptation of
word2vec, is an unsupervised algorithm that generates vectors for
sentence/paragraphs/documents, ordering the documents and semantic information from

the text corpus. There are many different word embedding models that, like doc2vec, can convert
