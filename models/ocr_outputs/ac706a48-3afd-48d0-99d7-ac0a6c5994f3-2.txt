more than one word to a numeric vector. These advances in the mapping of words and documents
to vectors significantly improved the quality of feature extraction in text mining. The possibility of
combining word embeddings and topology-preserving maps (i.e. SOM’s) represents a new and
exciting research direction. The possibility of coupling improved semantic properties with
clustering and visual analytics will allow the creation of effective interactive visual analytics
systems, improving access, while supporting serendipity in retrieval, browsing, and exploration of
text documents. The interactive visual analytics system proposed here, MapIntel, will represent a
significant improvement over the present situation at AICEP and a relevant scientific contribution
in the domain of text mining and visual analytics. The ability to cluster and make sense of very
large amounts of text documents will not only improve the quality of the strategic planning and
decision-making process, but it will also optimize resources by freeing analysts to focus on analysis
and adequately briefing policymakers.
